Therefore, a small class size is recommended to help CLIENT NAME sustain attention, as there will be less extraneous stimuli in the room to distract GENDER. A classroom that has reduced noise will help CLIENT NAME successfully complete GENDER tasks. A small class size will also allow CLIENT NAME to receive the attention GENDER needs to succeed.</li><li>When being asked a question or given a directive, CLIENT NAME will need extra time to process, respond, and act accordingly. It is also imperative to ensure that CLIENT NAME is not perseverating or fixating on preferred items during delivery of directions and commands.</li><li>As academic work increases in difficulty, CLIENT NAME will also benefit from being provided 50% extended time on tests and in-class activities.</li><li>CLIENT NAME’s attention and behavioral difficulties require significant levels of external structure and support. In the class, CLIENT NAME should be provided with predictable routines and clear-cut instructions and expectations. Teachers should speak slowly and repeat instructions as needed. Frequent monitoring should be done to ensure that GENDER remains on task.</li><li>Multi-step directions/requests and lengthy assignments should be broken down as well.</li><li>CLIENT NAME will often need directions and prompts repeated to GENDER, as well as having possible answer choices provided to GENDER.</li><li>GENDER will also be more successful when verbal directives are paired with visual images to help cue GENDER to listen and ensure GENDER attention. When GENDER is not able to follow directions and comply, it is imperative to make sure GENDER understands what is being asked of GENDER.</li><li>Preferential seating near the teacher and in the front of the classroom to help monitor difficulties with attention as well as processing difficulties.</li><li>Teachers and caretakers working with CLIENT NAME should utilize short-term rewards (rather than longer, delayed rewards) as well as frequent, sensory breaks to help GENDER stay engaged, motivated and on-task with GENDER activities.</li><li>CLIENT NAME should be provided with frequent breaks during classroom instruction for GENDER to fully comprehend the information and to increase GENDER overall compliance.</li><li>Learning activities that increase motivation and arousal will facilitate sustaining attention (e.g., interactive and hands-on), rather than desk work. CLIENT NAME appears to be more of a visual and hands on learner, therefore GENDER will be more likely to comprehend the information when auditory information is supplemented with visual-based instruction.</li><li>Teachers should assist in helping CLIENT NAME to make and maintain friendships in the classroom. Praise and encouragement should be used to reinforce appropriate social skills.</li><li>Utilizing similar language and prompts both at home and at school to help support CLIENT NAME when GENDER perseverates and demonstrates difficulties with cognitive flexibility.</li><li>Consistency and reliability should be implemented as much as possible (i.e., same seat every day, predictable and logical flow/routine during the day).</li><li>Use of a timer as well to help with transitions between activities.</li><li>Schedule changes and transitions should be discussed ahead of time (as frequently as possible) to help CLIENT NAME shift activities and maintain a sense of control.</li><li>It would be beneficial for CLIENT’s PARENTS to schedule an IEP meeting, to revise CLIENT NAME’s previous IEP to reflect GENDER diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder. It is important for the educational staff to be aware of CLIENT NAME’s difficulties socially, as well as GENDER difficulties sustaining attention.

To help GENDER, GENDER could also utilize an alarm on GENDER phone to signal when the hour is up so that GENDER does not lose track of time. (This can also be utilized while taking breaks in between assignments). To help GENDER stay motivated, CLIENT NAME could also reward GENDER during GENDER breaks by watching a preferred, short TV show or spending 15-30 minutes in a preferred activity.
